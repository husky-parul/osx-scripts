Steps to add new user on a system for git

I. Generating a new SSH key

    1. Open Terminal.

    2. Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

    	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

    	This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

    2. Generating public/private rsa key pair.

    	When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

	    Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

    	At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

    	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
    	Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

II. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

		Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not one installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.

		1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.

			ssh-agent -s

		2. If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

			    Host work.github.com
			    HostName github.com
			    User WORK_GITHUB_USERNAME
			    PreferredAuthentications publickey
			    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_work_rsa
			    IdentitiesOnly yes

			    Host personal.github.com
			    HostName github.com
			    User PERSONAL_GITHUB_USERNAME 
			    PreferredAuthentications publickey
			    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_personal_rsa
			    IdentitiesOnly yes

 		3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file

 			$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa

 III. change git config
 
 	#change it to use your custom `personal.github.com` hostname
	git remote rm origin
	git remote add origin git@personal.github.com:PERSONAL_GITHUB_USERNAME/project.git
